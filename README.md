# fetch_tolinkshare
~~This is a repo for grabbing v2ray nodes from [tolinkshare/freenode](https://github.com/tolinkshare/freenode) because I got too lazy to copy them by hand every time.~~

~~If you want to use this, copy [this link](https://github.com/errorduplicator/fetch_tolinkshare/raw/main/nodes.txt) and use it as a subscribtion url for whatever v2ray client in your favor.~~

~~Alternatively, if you are on a windows platform, you can download [this python script](https://github.com/errorduplicator/fetch_tolinkshare/blob/main/for_local_uses(windows).py) to your PC. Run it and the grabbed node goes to your clipboard. Then just open the V2rayN client (see[ here)](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN) and Ctrl+V.~~

Update:

Tolink seem to have deleted their github account, so this repo and everything within is no longer valid.
